# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal landing page for tsilva.eu, hosted on GitHub Pages. The site serves as a simple profile page with links to CV, GitHub, Hugging Face, LinkedIn, and X.

## Architecture

- **Static GitHub Pages site**: The README.md file serves as the landing page content
- **Custom domain**: Configured via CNAME file (www.tsilva.eu)
- **No build process**: Changes to README.md are deployed automatically by GitHub Pages

## Development

No local development setup required. Edit README.md directly and push to main branch to deploy.

## Important Guidelines

- README.md must be kept up to date with any significant project changes
